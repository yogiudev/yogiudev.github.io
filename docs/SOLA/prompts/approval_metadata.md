## üß† Key Concepts

1. üß© Module Reference
   `module_id` links this approval to a specific type of entity:
   "approval.module_id"

- 10 ‚Üí Incident
- 42 ‚Üí Request
- 47 ‚Üí Change

`ref_id` refers to the specific record ID in that module

2. üîÅ Approval Sequence
   `approval_sequence` tracks which stage is currently being handled

`approval_sent_to` stores each approver's status:

- `sequence` helps identify order
- `approval_state`:
  - 0 = Pending
  - 1 = Approved
  - 2 = Rejected

3. üë§ Team Ownership
   approval_team.team_id: Links to a team in the teams collection

This team‚Äôs sequence_staffs defines the approval path

4. üü¢ Status Tracking
   `overall_approval_state`: Reflects final result (approved/rejected/pending)

`is_approval_completed`: Indicates if the workflow node is fully passed

5. üõ† Workflow Integration
   `previous_status`: Carries information about the node prior to entering approval

`approval_block_flow_id`: Identifies the specific workflow block

`response_required`: Determines if each stage must receive a response

## üîë Primary Key

`approval_request_id` (string): Uniquely identifies each approval instance
