# Why SOLA ?

### **The Problem**

In enterprise environments — especially with tools like ITSM, OSS, NMS — users are overwhelmed. Not because systems lack features, but because they're buried under layers of complexity: menus, dashboards, filters, forms.

Business users, field teams, and even internal engineers spend **too much time just trying to get to what they need** — whether it's a simple SLA trend, a bulk action, or fetching data from multiple modules.

### **The Insight**

Every enterprise tool is built assuming someone will design a UI for every possible action.
But what if… that wasn’t needed?

What if the system *spoke your language*?
